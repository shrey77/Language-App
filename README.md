# Language-App
Language App is an Android app build to show the translation of common words/phrases from Spanish to English and will have the option to input your own phrase to translate through text or voice recognition.

This app is going to be build initially by following the Miwok and expanded upon through my own ideas(such as adding in user inputs)
